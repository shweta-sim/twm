        <h4>Section 18 - Modifications to the Service, Content and Prices</h4>
        <p class="mb30"> We pride ourselves in producing work of exceptional standards of delivery and would never intentionally submit final files with omissions and inaccuracies to you. However, we accept that due to the fallibility of our human nature this Site may unintentionally contain misinformation, typographical errors, omissions, or inaccuracies that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, availability, and various other information. <br>
          <br>
          We reserve the right to modify and correct any inaccuracies, errors, or omissions, cancel any orders, and to alter or update the information on the Site or any other related Site at any time, without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).<br>

          <br>

          <br>
          Similarly, due to the nature of creative design, we cannot guarantee all delivered files will be 100% error-free. You agree to review and proof all delivered files for any inaccuracies or omissions. In a rare event that you do receive a file with mistakes, please notify us promptly and no less seven (7) days of receipt. Then and we will do our best to quickly make the revisions and re-submit to you. If you notify us of any errors after that time period, we are not required to but will intend to work with you to make corrections as soon as there is available time.<br>
          <br>
          TW Media is not responsible or liable for any loss of profits or business incurred from inaccuracies in our design files. It is your sole responsibility to thoroughly check and review the final design before ordering print or finalising for marketing.</p>
        <h4>Section 19 – Early Upgrades</h4>
        <p class="mb30"> TW Media provides an initial free trial to allow potential / new clients the opportunity to assess the suitability of the Service for their project. If a client wishes to forego the free trial they will be required to participate in an onboarding call before their subscription can be made active in order to ensure they there are no ambiguities regarding the scope of the Service. The offer for a free trial is offered only once for each new client and not for each new order, product or project.<br>
          <br>
          Clients who choose to forego the free trial and thereafter determine that the Service is not suitable for their project are eligible to request a pro-rated refund should they decide to cancel the subscription before the end of the subscription period (i.e. before their next billing date). To request a pro-rated refund, clients may contact TW Media on the live chat at <a href="https://twmedia.co.uk/">www.twmedia.co.uk</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:info@twmedia.co.uk">info@twmedia.co.uk</a>.</p>
        <h4>Section 20 - Fees, Refunds and subscriptions</h4>
        <p class="mb30"> You understand that before we have any obligation to provide Services, you must pay the fees (as well as applicable taxes) in full, in such amounts and for such billing frequency as specified during registration, as updated (prospectively, not retroactively) by you from time to time. <br>
          <br>
          By entering into this Agreement with TV Media, you represent and warrant that the billing information you submit to TW Media is accurate, current on the submission date, and that you are authorised to make payment. Furthermore, you agree to pay the fees for monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, or annual subscription specified during registration in full prior to any Services being rendered by TW Media. You also agree to authorise TW Media to automatically charge you for the fee on your method of payment (e.g., credit card) and  applicable taxes on each anniversary of your registration date, based upon your billing frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually). In the event of non-payment of applicable fees your account and access to files and Services may be suspended or terminated and overdue charges will accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. All amounts owed under this Agreement are non-cancellable and non-refundable, except as specifically provided in this Agreement.<br>
          <br>
          We reserve the right to change our fees upon 5 days’ advance notice.  By continuing to use the Services, you accept such changes. We are not required to notify you of temporary promotions or reductions in fees. <br>
          <br>
          If you sign up for a trial it is your sole responsibility to cancel the Service within the trial period if you have not used the Service within the trial period, are not satisfied with the Service, or do not intend to use the Service beyond the trial.<br>
          <br>
          You may request to pause the monthly, quarterly, bi-annual or annual subscription for one or more months for a flat monthly fee. This will take effect as of the billing date, either within the current month if that date is still in the future, or in the next calendar month.<br>
          <br>
          Unless requested specifically requested by the client, the monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, or annual subscription will automatically renew for the same duration, at the same payment rate, at the end of a given term. Once a subscription payment has been processed, the Service will be delivered until the final date of the subscription period.<br>
          <br>
          We hope you are pleased with our Services.  If, for whatever reason, you are not, you may cancel your subscription with us at any time as your sole remedy. It is your sole responsibility to cancel or pause the subscription / Service, ahead of the billing date, if you do not intend to use the Service during a subscription period. Refunds will not be granted due to your inactivity as a TW Media client, or if you have forgotten to cancel their subscription prior to their billing date.
          You may cancel our Services anytime either by contacting <a href="mailto:support@twmedia.co.uk">support@twmedia.co.uk</a> or by speaking to a representative and outlining the grounds on which you are submitting your refund request. You are eligible for a full refund within 15/30 business days for any reason, however, all refund requests are reviewed, approved and processed at the sole discretion of TW Media and are subject to a 5% administrative fee. In some cases, we may refuse a refund request if, in our sole discretion, we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behaviour. Promotions, upgrades, and adjustments to existing plans are non-refundable:<br>
          <br>
          If a refund request is approved, the refund will be issued for the equivalent of one monthly payment add to the original payment method within 15 business days. Refund requests will not be approved for more than one monthly payment. After this 15/30 day window, we will not issue a refund.<br>
          <br>
          After cancellation, we will endeavour to keep your logins and account active in order for you to have access to all previously submitted design files until the end of your current billing period. Once the billing term has ended after cancelation, you will no longer have access to the Services and may lose access to your design files through the Site. </p>
