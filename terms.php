<p>2.2 You may only access and use the Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. You agree to: (i) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any form on this Site (“Registration Data”); (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, to keep it accurate, current and complete; (iii) maintain the security of any password and identification information; (iv) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account; (v) accept sole responsibility for any and all activities that occur on your account.  Each person who uses any Services must have a separate username and password.

<p>2.3 You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all telecommunications, broadband and computer equipment and services needed to access and use the Services and for paying all charges related thereto.</p>
<p>2.4 We may terminate your account without prior notice or liability to you, if we find, in our sole and exclusive discretion, that you: (i) have violated this Agreement; (ii) are not in alignment with our model; (iii) are sharing usernames or passwords; (iv) violate our core values; or (v) are abusing our services or team in any way, including using our services for illegal purpose.</p>
<p>2.5 “Licensed Content” means content that we own or license, including artwork, stock photographs, audio, typeface, video, designs, and writings. While you are, and will be, the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to your graphic design project, the Licensed Content incorporated in your graphic design project is subject to the license described in Section 4 below.  No rights are granted to you other than as expressly set forth herein. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, transferable, sublicensable right and license to commercially exploit in any manner any feedback, suggestions or recommendations that you provide to us. </p>
<p class="mb30">2.6 Subject to your continued compliance with this Agreement, including timely payment of associated amounts due, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable license to access and use the Services for your internal business purposes. You may not access or use the Services in order to monitor its availability, performance, or functionality for competitive purposes.

<h4>3. Use of the Services</h4>
<p>3.1 You may use the Services for any number of projects and scope that you have that you have subscribed for under the applicable plan and as are appropriate based on the size of your account. While we accept unlimited requests and revisions, our output volume depends on many factors, namely depending on the total request volume and complexity. We will do our best to work with you to accommodate any priority items and your timelines, but we suggest you do not use our Services for time-sensitive projects. </p>
<p>3.2 We do our best to minimize any mistakes. However, due to the nature of creative design, we cannot guarantee all files delivered will be 100% error-free. When we deliver a file to you, you agree to review and proof all files for any errors or omissions and notify us if any changes or corrections are needed within seven (7) days of receipt. We will do our best to rush edits to correct any mistakes that you notify us about during this time period. If you notify us of any errors after that time period, we are not required to but intend to try to work with you to make corrections.</p>
<p>3.3 The speed of your account is determined by how many subscriptions you have. A subscription is a measurement of output and represents what we can accomplish in a business day, with our team, our software, and our graphic design platform. What we can create with a single subscription depends on many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the type of plan; (ii) the volume of requests; (iii) and the complexity of requests. We do not guarantee the amount of work that we can create with a single subscription. To increase the volume of work we can complete within a business day, we suggest you add subscriptions to your account.</p>
<p>3.4 You are the owner and/or controller of all of your information, data or materials that you provide to us to use the Services (“Customer Content”). By submitting Customer Content to us, you are representing that you are the owner of such Customer Content and/or have the necessary rights, licenses, and authorization to distribute it.  You grant us a worldwide, royalty free, non-exclusive license to access and use Customer Content to provide the Services. </p>
<p>3.5 You are, and will be, the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. We agree that with respect to any deliverables that may qualify as “work made for hire” as defined in 17 U.S.C. §101, such deliverables are deemed a “work made for hire” for you. To the extent that any deliverables do not constitute a “work made for hire,” we irrevocably assign you all right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to the deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section 4.5 are subject to your compliance with this Agreement, your full payment of applicable amounts due and the terms of Sections 4.6  and 5 below.</p>
<p>3.6 In the course of providing the Services, we may use certain pre-existing materials.  We and our licensors are, and will remain, the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title, and interest in and to any pre-existing materials.  We grant you a perpetual, limited, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute any pre-existing materials to the extent incorporated in, combined with, or otherwise necessary for the use of the Services or deliverables.  We expressly reserve all other rights in and to such pre-existing materials.</p>
